ERR! Error : 'fhc initlocal <appId>' or 'fhc local <appId>' never called, see the usage for an explanation.
ERR! Usage: 
ERR!  fhc local <appID>
ERR!  This command (or the equivalent 'fhc initlocal <appID>') must be run at least
ERR!  once to initialize the local service. Note : this call will start the local
ERR!  client and cloud with the default host(127.0.0.1) and ports(8000/8001)
ERR!  fhc local <appID>* <cloudHost=host> <cloudPort=port>  <port=port>  <logprefix=true|false>  <loghighlight=true|false>
ERR!  where <appID> is the application id (aside from the initial call this parameter is optional)
ERR!  where <cloudHost> is the ip address or hostname you want to listen
ERR!        on (additionally we will generate urls with this host). Normally you 
ERR!        would want to set this value if you want to access the cloud/client from 
ERR!        a mobile device over your local router or through a public address. Note :
ERR!        this address is used for bloth your cloud and client urls.
ERR!  where <cloudPort> is the port that your cloud code uses for act calls (default : 8001). You 
ERR!        would only need to change this from the default if it clashes with
ERR!        another service
ERR!  where <port> is the port that serves your client content.(default : 8000). You would normally 
ERR!        only need to change this port if it clashes with another service. Or 
ERR!        you want to run another package
ERR!  where <logprefix> is a boolean indicator as to whether stdout and stderr messages should be prefixed 
ERR!        with their log types - 'CLOUD stdout:' and 'CLOUD stderr:' - respectively (default : false). 
ERR!  where <loghighlight> is a boolean indicator as to whether stdout and stderr messages should be 
ERR!        output in green or red text respectively (default : true). 
ERR! 
verbose exit [ 1, true ]
